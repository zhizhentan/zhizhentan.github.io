	People's material life is gradually becoming rich, and they have paid more attention in pursuit of spiritual experience by travelling. Travel has become an increasingly important and frequent activity in contemporary life and has become a part of life.<br><br>
Transboundary shoes design is a popular trend in current footwear design. It is mainly manifested in the cross-border integration of sports shoes and casual shoes. People who like sports often choose this type of sports and leisure crossover shoes, allowing the sport to intersperse in the main line daily life, so that exercise can be started at all times and places and in this way, life becomes dynamic. Therefore, I pondered whether I could connect travel and life closely and rationally through footwear design, making people experience the joy of urban walking, which can be considered as exploration in life, and make the trip as easy as daily life. <br><br>
When the author studied the travel behavior, he found that travel is the concentration of the life scenes on the timeline, which is a partial enlargement of life. It can be said that travel and daily life have the same attributes to some extent. The author was inspired by the analysis of the modular concept product, and believes that the modular design concept allows the user to switch modes of wearing shoes according to the scene and individual needs during the journey. At the same time, the feature of switching modes of wearing shoes can also be applied in the city scenes, making city walk satisfactory. The existing modular concept shoes focuses on exploring methods of modularization rather than considering how to apply the concept to actual user usage scenario. From this point of view, the content of this article belongs to the innovative application design of modular footwear design.<br><br>
This design is a pair of modular travel-city transboundary modular shoes, which is divided into four parts: outsole, insole, self-receiving uppers and cross combination straps. It can provide three forms through modular assembly or separate use. The modes of wearing make the shoes more versatile. There are both functional footwear innovations for the specific and complex behavior of travel, as well as a sense of comfort and style that is suitable to wear in daily situations. In addition, the alternative advantages of the modular design concept components allow the user to extend the life of the shoe by replacing the easy-damaged parts, and also to achieve personalized combinations of users.<br> </p>
