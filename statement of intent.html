<span class="p2" style="background-color:yellow;">Statement of Intent </span><br>

<br>
<br>

<span class="p2" style="background-color:yellow;">Domains:</span><br>
#Human biosignal<br>
#Collective creating<br>
#Human-space interaction<br>
#Social identity<br>

<br>

<span class="p2" style="background-color:yellow;">Interpretation of domains:</span><br>
Human biosignal: It is the natural attributes of humans. It is similar but not the same among individuals.<br>
Collective creating: How to make the longevity of creating.<br>
Human-space interaction: It is a medium which is the container of messages and at the same time it can a part of the messages.<br>
Social identity: it is the social problem I find and want to interpret by myself and make people really think about it.<br>


<br>

<span class="p2" style="background-color:yellow;">Domains:</span><br>
1. Human biosignal <br>

The first precedent work is a biosignal experiment made by Vasso Georgiadou in 2014. In this work, Georgiadou makes the heart sounded differently by using different signal amplifiers or exerting different external factors to the body. <br>

Biosignals are stable to a certain extent, because of homeostasis, which is the state of steady internal conditions maintained by living things. But we can control biosignals by changing their specific attributes (sounds in this case). Perhaps the controlled biosignals can be understood as the combination of human natural and human will.<br>


The second precedent work is the Emotion in motion (Niall Coghlan, 2010).  In this work, the participators’ biosignals ( Heartbeat . Oximetry . Electronic skin response), which are detected by sensors, reveals their emotions. Different emotions can trigger different music clips.  <br>

Biosignals, to some extent, can be considered as bridges of human inner activities and external displays.<br>

The third precedent work is the Theremin (Samuel Hoffman, 1929). Two metal antennas that sense the relative position of the thereminist's hands and control oscillators for frequency with one hand, and amplitude (volume) with the other. The player’s hands interfere with the electromagnetic fields distributed by the antennas and it is how sound comes out.<br>

In this case, human signals (or people themselves) interact with the environment signals. I suppose that the interaction between human signals and environment signals could be a good way for human-space interaction.<br>

<br>



2. Collective creating<br>

he first work is The Obliteration Room(Yayoi Kusama, 2002-present). The artist creates a space with white furniture and white walls. people can put the provided colorful circle stickers on wherever as their wishes in the space. <br>

The output of this artwork is a unique and unduplicatable space. The only things the people can control are which colors to use, where to put on the stickers ( and when to put on the stickers, if video documentation is one of the output) To this extent, all the participators are considered as the same, or as the unity in this case. <br>

The second precedent work is SEGNI MOSSI A MARIA DE LA SALUT (Alessandro Lumare 2016). In this artwork, canvas and color pencils are provided to the participators, who can use their bodies as compasses to draw circles on the canvas (of course they can draw whatever they want, but most of them tend to draw circles). <br>

Because the collective creators have different physical sizes, their “compasses” are different in scales. To this extent, the individuals participating in the collective creating are similar, but not the same. It is fun to mention that, some works like faces, why? Is it because circle is the most important and representative formal elements of creatures? Circles come from lives, represent lives and creating lives? I think in this work, individuals are equally（commonality) and differently (individuality) participate in collective creating.<br>


The third precedent work is Collective Intelligence Machines (CIMs) (Maurizio Bolognini, 2000). Everybody can modify the patterns of projection by using the signal of their cell phones.<br>

Using a cell phone signal as the controller reminds me that cell phones have become a necessary part of human life. Can a cell phone be considered as a part of the human body? Can a cell phone signal be considered as one of the human biosignals? If yes, it can be regarded as using neo-biosignal to collectively create.<br>

<br>

3. Human-space interaction<br>
The first precedent work is Dune (STUDIO ROOSEGAARDE, 2006-2012). The public installation is composed of hundreds of fibers that brighten according to the sounds and motions of passing visitors.<br>

In this case, the environment can perceive and react to people in a distance but it can not change the behaviors of them. I deem it as the first level of human-space interaction.<br>

The second precedent work is Marbles (STUDIO ROOSEGAARDE, 2012-2022). The interactive light and sound installations transform public space into an interactive landscape of play and enhance social interactions.<br>

In this case, people can play with the environment and change the appearance of it. At the meanwhile, with the installation, the environment can re-shape people's behaviors. Also, it is obvious that the distance between people and the environment is shortened.<br>

The third precedent work is Colorway (BEOMKI LEE, 2016). People in this architecture can use stickers of different colors to collectively create the appearance of the space.<br>

In this work, the effect people that exert on the environment can be preserved, which I consider as the biggest difference from the first two precedent works in this domains.<br>

<br>


<span class="p2" style="background-color:yellow;">Preliminary concepts:</span><br>
1. Heartbeat can speak: The internet data are transferred as the bytes consistent of “0” and “1”. Perhaps after translate heartbeat into bytes, the heartbeat can say something.<br>
<br>
2. Remote collective work: somebody who deem themselves a modern society citizen may have some bias towards the places on the different sides of the Earth. Someone may hold the idea that people from mid-eastern still ride camels to commute， some may think every Chinese can play Kong-fu … All in all, they may think people from other places behave differently. Perhaps something can be designed to make them do something by cooperation and in this way to break the bias.<br>
